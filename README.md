# The Bill, Please

This app is an open-source project made for the purpose of training and learning how Android applications work.  

This is only the beginning of the project, not much has been done yet.

# Have you ever been in a pub?

You know, when you're with your friends and the time comes to pay.  

The bill arrives.  

Tension rises.  

The ticket seems longer than ever as the waiter brings it to your table.  

You can feel it in the air: you'll be the one to pay because no one else dares to say, **"Hey guys, let's split the bill, shall we?"**  

Just as you pull out your card, the payment machine declines the transaction.  

Now your friends have to cover the cost. Frustrated with the situation, they turn on you.  
Your girlfriend admits she’s always loved your best friend, and your mother (who was somehow at the table too) reveals that you’re adopted.

It all could have been avoided if you had an app that made splitting the bill easy, right?



## What the app does:

This app aims to solve that problem with ease:

- Capture Receipts: Take a photo of your restaurant receipt or any bill.
- Automatic Item Detection: Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scan and identify the items and their costs.
- Assign Items to People: Choose which items each person is responsible for.
- Split the Bill: The app will calculate how much each person owes, including tips or tax.
- Share the Bill: Send the results to your friends via email or text so they can easily see what they owe.

No more awkward conversations at the end of the night. Let The Bill, Please handle it for you.
